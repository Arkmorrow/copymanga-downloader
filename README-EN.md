## Introduction üóíÔ∏è

This program uses `python` to download comics from copymanga

And it supports full download as well as range download (e.g. `10-20` words, or `11` words)

And while I was writing it, I noticed that the order of the pictures in each chapter of copymanga seems to be messed up.

But there is also a `word` array corresponding to the order of each picture, so just a small change, after downloading 99% is the correct order of qwq

(If not then download it again and send **issuse** it if you still have it qwq)

If you are an Android user, then you can use the [tachiyomi](https://github.com/tachiyomiorg/tachiyomi) client to try to download (but you need to install the `copymanga` plugin)

If you need to stitch images **right to left** and in groups of two, you can try using `Image_ stitching.exe` in [this version]() to achieve this (only simple functions are provided, no optimization is made)

```

### About the code

#### About sometimes the download gets stuck

This should be a limitation of copymanga's server

It's definitely not my problem!

If this happens, please `Ctrl+C` to terminate the program and use `range download` or `single talk download`.

(In fact, the code used for the single word download and the range download is the same, except that the two parameters of the range download are directly combined into one qwq)

Or maybe it's already done, but it hasn't ended the loop qwq

#### about code annotation

Because code annotation uses VScode's `Better Comments` plugin to make annotations with corresponding colors to allow developers to analyze code more clearly.

So it is recommended that you also install this plugin to get a better understanding of the code
